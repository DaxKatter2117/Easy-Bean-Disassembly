Utility: Puyo Compressor
Creator: AdolescentSeagull

This tool allows you to compress graphics (4BPP Format) to the "Puyo Compression" format. This format is used in the following Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis games:
- Puyo Puyo (JPN)
- Puyo Puyo 2 (JPN)
- Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (USA/EUR)**
- Madou Monogatari I (JPN)

** All the new graphics are compressed with the "Nemesis Compression", while the ones from Puyo Puyo use the "Puyo Compression".

You will need to install Python3 to use the tool: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Just drag the uncompressed graphic (4BPP) file into "Puyo Compressor.bat" (the file name MUST NOT have any spaces), and the new compressed file with the file type ".puyo" will be generated.
